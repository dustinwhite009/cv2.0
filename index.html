        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p class="code-skill-desc">I always had a passion for computers and their inner workings, however it wasn't until my 30's
          that I discovered a passion for code over hardware. I went back to school for a Computer Science
          degree and have become aquainted with multiple languages. It didn't take long for me to realize
          that this new love of mine was going to take a lot of work and time, but I am dedicated to becoming
          a full-stack developer one day and my appetite for knowledge seems insatiable!</p>

        <h3>Hands on mechanics and technology</h3>

          with a variety of cool gadgets. This allows me to use my knowledge of electrical devices to incorporate
          new and exciting technology into every cart we build.</p>
